### Interface6: This was a simple interface exercise. In this exercise i had to make a simple form. The exercise was pretty simple. The only difficulty i face was finding the right color and font-family 
for the text. 

### Interface10: This was bit more complex. I had to make 4 cards of profile. I used grid for this. I didn't really face any difficulties making this but it took twice as long 
because i didn't wanted to make any mistakes.
